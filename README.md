ðŸ”— Live Site: [Open Arms](https://nikosdiakonis.github.io/openarms/)

This project was developed for a web development e-learning program at the National and Kapodistrian Univercity of Athens. The assignment required the use of a reference site, for which I selected [watershed.ngo](https://watershed.ngo). I aimed to match its aesthetics while fulfilling the assignment's criteria.

Features:
1. Common Elements: Consistent Header and Footer across all pages. 
    - Navbar: Adaptable based on screen width, featuring a custom logo and primary navigation links.
    - Footer: Dark-themed, offering organization info, Google Maps integration, social links, and a newsletter form.

2. Home Page: Carousel displaying organizational activities and "latest updates" cards.

3. About Us: Central image with a "About Us" title popping up after a delay, content design aligned with the reference website.

4. Events: Display of organization's projects and an events calendar, separated by an animated CSS plane.

5. Contact Us: Visuals followed by a delayed "Contact Us" message, team members' display, and a contact form.

6. Donate: Introductory image for donations and sections with "Donate Now" buttons.

For a comprehensive view, it's recommended to visit the live site.
