ðŸ”— **[Live Site: Open Arms](https://nikosdiakonis.github.io/openarms/)**

This project was developed as part of a web development e-learning program at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The technologies employed include HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. The primary aim of this project was to gain proficiency with Bootstrap for crafting responsive web pages.

### Inspiration

The assignment necessitated the use of a reference site. I opted for [watershed.ngo](https://watershed.ngo) due to its compelling color scheme and the minimalist approach the developer embraced in structuring the site.

### Features

- **Common Elements**: Uniform Header and Footer across all pages.
  
- **Navbar**: Adaptable based on screen width, showcasing a custom logo alongside primary navigation links.
  
- **Footer**: Features a dark theme and includes organization details, Google Maps integration, social media links, and a newsletter subscription form.
  
- **Home Page**: A carousel that depicts organizational activities and "latest updates" cards.
  
- **About Us**: Central image with an "About Us" title appears after a slight delay, content design in harmony with the reference website.
  
- **Events**: Presentation of the organization's projects alongside an events calendar, separated by an animated CSS divider.
  
- **Contact Us**: Visual graphics followed by a "Contact Us" title appearing after a delay, showcases team members, and incorporates a contact form.
  
- **Donate**: An evocative image for donations complemented by sections with "Donate Now" buttons.

For a detailed experience, it's advised to visit the live site.
