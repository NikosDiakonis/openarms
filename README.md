This project was developed for a web development e-learning program at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. 
The technologies employed include HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. 
The primary aim of this project was to familiarize ourselves with Bootstrap in constructing responsive web pages. 
The assignment required the use of a reference site, for which I selected [watershed.ngo](https://watershed.ngo).
I aimed to match its aesthetics while fulfilling the assignment's criteria.

Features:

Common Elements: Consistent Header and Footer across all pages.

Navbar: Adaptable based on screen width, featuring a custom logo and primary navigation links. 

Footer: Dark-themed, offering organization info, Google Maps integration, social links, and a newsletter form.

Home Page: Carousel displaying organizational activities and "latest updates" cards.

About Us: Central image with an "About Us" title popping up after a delay, content design aligned with the reference website.

Events: Display of the organization's projects and an events calendar, separated by an animated CSS plane.

Contact Us: Visuals followed by a delayed "Contact Us" message, team members' display, and a contact form.

Donate: Introductory image for donations and sections with "Donate Now" buttons.

For a comprehensive view, it's recommended to visit the live site.
